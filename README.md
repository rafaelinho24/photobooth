# steaksoap

**The AI-native React system for solo builders.**

You describe it. The AI builds it. 22 commands, 4 agents, zero config.

Not another React boilerplate — a complete development system where AI rules, commands, and agents are the product. The React starter is the vehicle.

## Why steaksoap?

There are hundreds of React + Vite + Tailwind starters. Here's what makes this one different:

| | steaksoap | Typical React Starter |
|---|---|---|
| **AI workflow** | 22 slash commands, 4 sub-agents | None or afterthought |
| **Setup** | One interactive wizard | Clone + manual config |
| **UI components** | 14 accessible atoms ready to use | Empty src/ |
| **Git workflow** | Conventional commits + auto changelog | Manual |
| **Validation** | Lint + typecheck + test + build in one command | `npm run build` |
| **Releases** | Automated version bump + changelog + tag | Manual |
| **Multi-AI** | Claude Code + Cursor + Copilot rules | Single tool or none |

## Prerequisites

Before you start, install these (once):

1. [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org) — download and run the installer
2. pnpm — open a terminal and run: `npm install -g pnpm`
3. [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) — your AI copilot
4. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) — open the project, accept recommended extensions when prompted

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/mitambuch/steaksoap.git my-project
cd my-project
pnpm install
pnpm setup

# Start building
pnpm dev
```

The setup wizard will:
- Rename the project to your chosen name
- Configure git remotes
- Clean up template files
- Give you a ready-to-use project
